        it is the new year , and i already made a journal on how it went 
        i didnt make it dramatic or anthing , i just mentioned what i have done 
        throughout the year , and the final week went crazy , home chores , studies 
        , the 12th book that is the most complexe ever , the python  and Ai learning . 
        this project is a commitment , and i am willing to take it
    </p>


    <p class="p2">
        well , to be completely clear, I am willing to try and log in everyday, not only 2 days or 5 days a week 
        but every single day , no matter what happens , i will log in here and write something, and it will follow 
        either a soft skill or resuming a project , does not matter , and i will make time for the book writing
        thing , yeah this year will be pretty good
