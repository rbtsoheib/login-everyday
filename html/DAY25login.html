    <h1>
        well you guessed it, it is day 25 of everyday login . i do not really understand why 
        i feel far behind in my journey, i am doing very well 
    </h1>

    <p>
        i thought if i write it in a paragraphe it would be more acceptable or genuin
        but the reality is strong and powerful , more than i can endure . no strength will save me from these ideas 
        this addiction is serious. i have been trying for 10 years now. this 1st day of december of 2025 
        feels different, the proof is that i am writing it in an html file. suicide is not really an option
        it is just a sign of giving up and weakness , all i will do is keep it to myself and work harder everyday
        because the time i have left will be more fun to spend on real connections and things i really enjoy , 
        rather than following what my brain needs to stop banging me with thoughts of it. so from this 
        day on , it is done, no other options. either this or this . 
    </p>
