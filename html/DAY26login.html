    <h1>
        this is day 26 of everyday login, well it is the same day 
        as the 25day , but yeah anyway 
    </h1>

    <p>
        well i do not have much to say today but all i can say is 
        i am trying , but is everything against it, i mean, i do 
        understand that doing what you want is hard , but this is 
        way too much , and i am getting beaten and punished for 
        something good i did or am doing , it is very frustrating , 
        but what is more frustrating is that i cannot communicate it 
        , all i can do is think about it for a second, try to understand its meaning 
        wonder why is this okay , and then just accepting i suppose since nothing is going according 
        to what i am planning. well , i do not know what i am supposed
        to do than somwthing right ? should i do something wrong ? 
        i really am confused , but yeah i cannot do anything about it.
    </p>
